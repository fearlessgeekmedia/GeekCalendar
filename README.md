## GitHub Sync

To sync your calendar with a GitHub repository, you need to create a `config.yml` file at `~/.config/geekcalendar/config.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
github:
  owner: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
  repo: YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME
  path: calendar.json # You can change the filename if you want
  token: YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Replace the placeholder values with your GitHub username, the name of the repository you want to sync to, and a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope.

Once you have configured the `config.yml` file, you can use the `y` key in the application to sync your calendar data.
